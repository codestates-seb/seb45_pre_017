export const dummyAnswer: string = `Following previous case...

In Simple.aspx, user has to enter the name of a company. If user don't remember name of the company, he can click a button which will open a pop up modal window.

what I want to do in the modal window is permit the user to do a search of a list of companies. He can enter a partial name and click search. Matches will be shown in a list below. He can click in an item of the list and return. If company does not exist, he can click a button 'New' to create a new company.

So, as you can see, I want a lot of functionality in this modal window.

Thanks!
