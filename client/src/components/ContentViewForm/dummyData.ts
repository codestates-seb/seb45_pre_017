export const dummyQuestion: string = `I have a list of items, each of which may have their display style toggled on or off at any time as a result of user actions.

With pure CSS, I would like to place a horizontal divider between each item.

The divider needs to disappear if any of the items are set to display: none, so that you don't get two directly adjacent dividers.

Should I be using flexbox or grid to solve this problem instead?`;
